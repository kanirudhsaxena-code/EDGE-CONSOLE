# MDOS VNext specification binding — 22 Sep 2026

Status: IMPLEMENTATION BINDING / NON-PRODUCTION

This repository branch is governed by the approved additive VNext specification package. This binding authorizes implementation and validation only. It does not authorize a change to frozen production methodology, canonical selection, official efficacy, recommendation semantics, or trading execution.

## VNext implementation invariants

1. Official efficacy stays canonical-only.
2. Learning evidence may include CANONICAL, DIAGNOSTIC, MANUAL and SHADOW runs, with explicit run-role metadata and target-date normalization.
3. Learning Lab failures never invalidate an otherwise valid production forecast.
4. User approval of a Learning Lab candidate authorizes governed build/validation only; production promotion is a separate explicit event.
5. Core Zone remains SHADOW until separately promoted.
6. PVPO Grid V1 is explanatory/read-model only until separately promoted.
7. Forecast payload completeness, assessment state and official-efficacy eligibility are separate states.
8. Exact-run report views are immutable and identified by a version and content hash.
9. Historical missing issuance-time evidence is never reconstructed as official forward evidence.
10. No branch in this workstream may place orders or enable trading execution.

## Build sequence

G3 — shared read-only/additive Learning Lab data model, observation ingestion, daily snapshots, hypotheses/challenger records and approval ledger.
G4 — Console Learning Lab overview/drill-down and stale/failure/approval UI.
G5 — EDGE Stocks D through D+4 forecast path.
G6 — Core Zone SHADOW implementation after engine annexes.
G7 — PVPO Grid V1 read model/rendering.
G8 — exact-run report view and Console/ChatGPT parity.
G9 — regression and non-disruption acceptance before any promotion.

## Repository role

EDGE Console is the shared control-plane/read-model owner for VNext Learning Lab presentation and additive shared ledger structures. It must not reproduce or mutate engine analytical methodology.
